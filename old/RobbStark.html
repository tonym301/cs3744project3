        <p><b>Birth 281 AD: </b><br/>Robb was born in the castle of Winterfell. He was the first son of Eddard Satrk and the rightful heir to the northern throne. His birth was in the middle of the summer years.<br/><br/>
        <b>First Battle - Battle of the Twin Rivers: </b><br/>Robb's first battle was also his first victory. He wore his own plated armor and commanded the bannermen that pledged to house Stark. He fought bravely and had a comfirmed kill count of 5.<br/><br/>
        <b>Second Battle Battle - Defence of Winterfell: </b><br/>Robb was forced to fight savages that teamed up against his home castle. This was an especially important event to Robb because he had the chance to prove his stength to his family and earn the honor of the Stark name. The defence was successful and Robb ws awarded a new set of armor.<br/><br/>
